#Source Randomizer
##What is is?
This program randomizes source games that were made prior 2007.
It can randomize sounds, textures, and models.

##History
This is a project that I started a year ago.
It was at first a way of making an even older program idea work by including textures along with the sounds in the randomization.
It ended up being a success and has been used by many people over youtube, most notably Vinesauce.
Later on, I declared the project dead as I went on to make it's predecessor. Long story short the predecessor ended up being too ambitious and went nowhere.

##A warning to new contributors
This project was never meant to be shared with anyone in a semi-professional manner.
Thus much of the code is essentially spaghetti code. I've cleaned it up to the best of my ability.
